.SH NAME
fedora-review \- Automatically review RPM packages for Fedora.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fedora-review
-b <bug number>
.br
.B fedora-review
-n <package name>

.SH DESCRIPTION

This tool makes reviews of rpm packages for Fedora easier. It tries to automate most of the process.
Through a json API the checks can be extended in any programming language and for any programming language.
We have at the moment checks for C/C++, R, Java and Perl packages.

.SH USAGE
This program runs a number of checks for packages in Fedora.
.HP
fedora-review -b <bug number>

It will download the SPEC & SRPM files from the Bugzilla report and
build them in mock and run a number of test and generate a report
there will be opened in editor along with the spec file, so the things
not automated can be reviewed manually.

.HP
fedora-review -n <package name>

This alternative usage expects <package name>.spec and source rpm in current
directory.

.PP
You will need to have mock installed and be member of the mock group
for the build to work. Run as root:
.HP
 usermod -a -G mock [your user name] && newgrp mock

.PP
To assign bugs in bugzilla automatically you will first have to login
into bugzilla (--login). This will create a bugzilla cookie so you
don't have to login every time.
